# HTML Rules for SEO-Optimized Websites  

## 1. Use Semantic HTML  
- Use appropriate semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) for better readability and accessibility.  
- Avoid excessive use of `<div>` and `<span>` when more meaningful tags are available.  

## 2. Optimize HTML for SEO  
- Ensure a well-structured DOM hierarchy with meaningful heading levels (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).  
- Only one `<h1>` per page, typically as the main title.  
- Use descriptive and concise `<title>` and `<meta description>` tags.  
- Include **structured data (Schema.org markup)** where applicable (e.g., articles, events, products).  

## 3. Enhance Accessibility (ARIA & More)  
- Use **ARIA attributes** (`role`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-hidden`, etc.) only when necessary.  
- Prefer **native HTML elements** with built-in accessibility over ARIA whenever possible.  
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation support.  

## 4. Improve Performance & Loading Speed  
- Use **lazy loading** (`loading="lazy"`) for images and iframes.  
- Minimize unnecessary HTML nesting to improve rendering efficiency.  
- Optimize HTML file size and reduce excessive whitespace/comments.  

## 5. Optimize Links & Navigation  
- Use **meaningful anchor text** instead of generic “Click Here.”  
- Ensure **internal linking** is well-structured with breadcrumb navigation where applicable.  
- Set `rel="nofollow"` for links to untrusted or low-value pages.  

## 6. Optimize Forms & Inputs  
- Use proper input types (`<input type="email">`, `<input type="tel">`, etc.) to improve UX and validation.  
- Always provide `<label>` elements for inputs, and associate them using the `for` attribute.  
- Utilize `autocomplete` attributes where relevant for improved form usability.  

## 7. Mobile & Responsive Best Practices  
- Ensure **mobile-first design** using responsive `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`.  
- Avoid fixed widths in elements to support different screen sizes.  
- Use CSS media queries instead of inline `style` for better maintainability.  

## 8. Security & Best Practices  
- Always use **HTTPS** to secure content and improve SEO ranking.  
- Set `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links that open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`) to improve security.  
- Avoid inline JavaScript and styles to enhance performance and security.  

## 9. Reduce Unnecessary Markup  
- Remove empty `<div>` and `<span>` elements.  
- Avoid excessive nesting of elements to simplify the DOM.  
- Ensure code is **clean and well-indented** for better maintainability.  

## 10. Use Proper Metadata  
- Define language using `<html lang="en">` for international SEO.  
- Add `meta charset="UTF-8"` to ensure proper character encoding.  
- Set up **Open Graph (`og:`)** and **Twitter Card metadata** for better social media previews.
